# My Portfolio Website
This is a personal portfolio website that showcases my projects and skills. It's designed to be a central hub for potential employers or collaborators to learn more about me and see examples of my work.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This site was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I focused on creating a clean, responsive design that works well on both deskstops and mobile. Each section - About Me, Projects, Skills and Contact - was carefully structured to be accessible and visually appealing.

I also used Git and GitHub for version control and deployment via GitHub Pages. This allows me to maintain a clear history of changes and easily publish updates.

## Lessons Learned:
Building the portfolio taught me how to:
- structurre a full website from the ground up only using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- use GitHub Pages for free hosting and version control
- organize project sections and content to highlight my strengths as a developer
- make layout decisions using Flexbox and Grid for different screen sizes
